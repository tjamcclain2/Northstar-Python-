# Northstar Algorithm Performance Testing

This branch focuses on performance testing the Northstar algorithm after its recent Python rewrite. In particular, we want to evaluate how the algorithmâ€™s performance scales with GPU type and number when parallelized on AWS.

## Overview

- Step-1: Profile the algorithm using Snakeviz (uses Cprofile and Pstats)
- Step-2: Fix the space and time complexity issues
