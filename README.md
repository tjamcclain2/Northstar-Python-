# Subproject-1:

## Northstar Algorithm Performance Testing

Performance testing: The Northstar algorithm has not be tested extensively since its Python rewrite. For example, it is not yet clear how the algorithmâ€™s performance scales with GPU type or number when parallelization is left to AWS. Working on this sub-project would require mastering the AWS console and learning to start, run, and transfer data to and from AWS, which constitute the nuts and bolts of high-performance computing in the cloud.

## Overview

- Step-1: Profile the algorithm using Snakeviz (uses Cprofile and Pstats) [done]
- Step-2: Optimize the algorithm at code level --> Goal: Make sure you have algorithmic efficiency
- Step-3: Optimize at server-level --> Is my algorithm giving the best performance across all GPU instances?
