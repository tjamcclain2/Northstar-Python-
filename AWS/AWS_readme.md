## ðŸ’¸ AWS Cost Fix â€“ July 2025

### Budget Setup
- Created a `$60` monthly budget named `SRS 2025`
- Email alerts at 85%, 100%, and forecasted 100% spend
- Notifications sent to `ajeem@mail.wlu.edu`

### EC2/EBS Issue
- Found ~$15/month from unused **EBS volumes** via **Cost Explorer**
- Went to **EC2 > Volumes**, identified unattached volumes
- **Detached and deleted** them to stop charges

### âœ… Result
- Stopped recurring EBS charges
- Budget now active to prevent future overspending
